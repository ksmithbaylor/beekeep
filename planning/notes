My notes from phone call:

Problem:

Can't tell which farm they were on, pollenation/making honey, need to know everything about each hive

Track:

if been treated for mites or foul-brood
what treatment did he use
successful?
add treatments later on
prompt to go check how the treatment is doing, or re-treat

metadata
where they came from
pollenating

if you've fed, them, when did they feed them, and what

employee info: send frank out to treat bees, be able to know who screwed up

start with the hives
screen building pallette
select hives for a pallette together
track things by pallette, and it would apply to all hives on that pallette
bee yard
scan a hive, ask whether to apply it to the whole pallette or the individual hive

yard -> pallette -> hive

hive: active or inactive (q or not)

queens
origin of the queen

customizable, add and subtract parameters

track failures and stuff across queen suppliers, treatments, etc

bar code

when scanning:
gps location
weather
time
when looking at a hive, show last scan and all the info about it

run a report and see whether hives die more in the center or end

form factor??
mobile app, website, etc
sync??

what is his current solution, and has he looked at other software products out there?
